# Project Description

On my journey to becoming a developer, I sought practical ways to apply my newly acquired knowledge. To achieve this, I created a webpage of my resume using HTML and CSS.

Though I am in the early stages of learning, this project has significantly pushed, challenged, and motivated me to continue moving forward and, most importantly, to keep learning. This was my first experience with HTML, and I utilized basic styling from style.css to enhance the page's appearance.

**CSS:** Applied basic styles to improve the visual appeal of the resume.

## Learning Outcomes

- Gained hands-on experience with HTML and CSS.
